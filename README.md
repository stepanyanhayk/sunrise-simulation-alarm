# Sunrise Simulation Alarm with Arduino

Studying biological rhythms has revealed that our bodies are naturally attuned to the cycles of light and darkness in our environment.

The sunrise simulation alarm clock proposes an innovative wake-up solution by using an Arduino microcontroller to gradually turn on LED strip lights in the room, waking the user up more gently and effectively compared to the conventional alarm sound.
